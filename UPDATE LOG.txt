06/22 Update: 	Added external functions for plotting (/subfunctions)
		Fixed a bug in crc_eeg_readHeaderEDF.m (/Preprocessing-pipeline/FAAST_tools). Thanks Aaron!
		Modified plot_mesh and plot_3dslice to show slice plane if no free surfer model is identified (/subfunctions/plotting)
		Modified plot_window function, now can select which conditions to plot (/subfunctions/plotting)
		Added missing subfunctions
06/23 Update: 	Some changes to improve speed.
		Artifact removel control in GUI (by changeing the NAN window size. Previously disabled).
		Additional baseline method added. 
		Add different colors to electrode groups and showing electrode labels.
		Optimized the funcitons to automatically identify tasks/load files/locate imaging data.
06/28 Update:	Fixed tons of bugs. 
		Improved speed.
		Optimized the code for mismatched channel labels (between edf file and image data).. but there are always thousands of ways of getting errors -- if there's any trouble linking the signal to subject's image just igore the image part (when choosing image folder click on cancel).
		Did some minor changes in SPM files so don't forget to replace the original functions in the SPM_toReplace folder.
		Tips: 	-- Change param in the main function to switch between GUI/no-GUI;
			-- Change notch settings in the main function (line 109) when processing data from China/US cohorts.
			-- Put bad chan index to exclude (e.g. redundant channels collected from China) in the main function.
			-- The viewer can now be used to review the results generated from origianl pipeline (SHFBXXX.mat file) by running "script_view_results.m" and select files (but still need some testing).
07/16 Update:	Fixed several bugs. 
		Improved the code to analyze unrecognized task (Thanks to Jeniffer). 
		Added significance test when running the GUI. 
		Channels with significant activation will be marked with "*" in different colors. Still need to be tested but should become a useful tool.
		
07/21 Update:	Changed LBCN_epoch_bc function to make it more compatible with "unknown" type of task.
		Fixed a bug in LBCN_plot_HFB. Now it reads the input params correctly when using epoched signal ("Epoched_data_TASK.mat") as the input (before it was overwritting the input params using default settings).
08/01 Update:	The software is now compatible with new data structure. When saving figures it also saves corresponding MRI slices. 
10/08 Update:	Major update. The viewer is more compatible with different tasks/undefined task/results generated by different pipelines; To convert results generated by SPM independent pipeline, run the ConcatenateAll function by Pedro.
		Tips: 	-- To use the pipeline, download the entire packet (including the Preprocessing-pipeline-master folder). Before installing, remove any old LBCN pipeline directory in your computer. Keep SPM 12 folder in the saved directory, and add the new pipeline packet. 
			-- To start with the GUI, run "plot_win_App", and choose "open" (for edf) or "load" (for saved results or epoched data) accordingly. The pipeline will try to identify the sbj name/task name, but if it fails, a window will pop out for user to manually type in the information. 
			-- You can also define new task or change baseline/epoching configurations by clicking on the "Add task" button. A list of pre-defined tasks were already saved and can be chosen from this pop-up window.  
			-- To start without the GUI, run "LBCN_preprocessing_new" to analyze new edf file, or "LBCN_plot_HFB" to open results or epoched files. This will also open the GUI at the end of the pipeline for better visuallization. To avoid this, go to LBCN_plot_HFB and uncomment the line with "plot_scrip" and comment the rest.
			-- For the first time when opening the result of a subject, the user may need to choose the image directory on the server. The pipeline will download necassary files and save them in the local directory. To open without loading the image just click on cancel. 
			-- A more detailed documentation will be uploaded soon. 
10/09 Update:	Bug fix.		
10/11 Update:	Bug fix. Please download the updated Main funcitons (LBCN_preprocessing_new, LBCN_plot_HFB) + subfunction folder. 
		Added a simplified version of the GUI to make it more compatible with early matlab versions. 
		To use it, uncomment line 503 in LBCN_plot_HFB, comment line 501, and do the same in view_result.m; run "plot_window" to open the simplified version of GUI. 
		This has not been tested on many datasets, an update of matlab is still recommended. 
		Now Supports TDT labeling.
		
10/18 Update:	Major update -- added permutation test (and plot). Pvalues can be exported to workspace using "Export". Thanks Ying and Pedro for your inspiration!
		Image path, significant results, and some other information are saved after getting the user's input. 
		Please also download crc_eeg_rdata_edf.m, crc_eeg_readHeaderEDF.m and replace the original funcitons in the LBCN old pipeline/FASST_tools to avoid saturation issue. Thanks Aaron!
		Next update wille include a simple heat map to show the activations.
