06/22 Update: 	Added external functions for plotting (/subfunctions)
		Fixed a bug in crc_eeg_readHeaderEDF.m (/Preprocessing-pipeline/FAAST_tools). Thanks Aaron!
		Modified plot_mesh and plot_3dslice to show slice plane if no free surfer model is identified (/subfunctions/plotting)
		Modified plot_window function, now can select which conditions to plot (/subfunctions/plotting)
		Added missing subfunctions
06/23 Update: 	Some changes to improve speed.
		Artifact removel control in GUI (by changeing the NAN window size. Previously disabled).
		Additional baseline method added. 
		Add different colors to electrode groups and showing electrode labels.
		Optimized the funcitons to automatically identify tasks/load files/locate imaging data.
06/28 Update:	Fixed tons of bugs. 
		Improved speed.
		Optimized the code for mismatched channel labels (between edf file and image data).. but there are always thousands of ways of getting errors -- if there's any trouble linking the signal to subject's image just igore the image part (when choosing image folder click on cancel).
		Did some minor changes in SPM files so don't forget to replace the original functions in the SPM_toReplace folder.
		Tips: 	-- Change param in the main function to switch between GUI/no-GUI;
			-- Change notch settings in the main function (line 109) when processing data from China/US cohorts.
			-- Put bad chan index to exclude (e.g. redundant channels collected from China) in the main function.
			-- The viewer can now be used to review the results generated from origianl pipeline (SHFBXXX.mat file) by running "script_view_results.m" and select files (but still need some testing).
