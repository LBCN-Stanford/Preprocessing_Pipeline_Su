06/22 Update: 	Added external functions for plotting (/subfunctions)
		Fixed a bug in crc_eeg_readHeaderEDF.m (/Preprocessing-pipeline/FAAST_tools). Thanks Aaron!
		Modified plot_mesh and plot_3dslice to show slice plane if no free surfer model is identified (/subfunctions/plotting)
		Modified plot_window function, now can select which conditions to plot (/subfunctions/plotting)
		Added missing subfunctions
06/23 Update: 	Some changes to improve speed.
		Artifact removel control in GUI (by changeing the NAN window size. Previously disabled).
		Additional baseline method added. 
		Add different colors to electrode groups and showing electrode labels.
		Optimized the funcitons to automatically identify tasks/load files/locate imaging data.
06/28 Update:	Fixed tons of bugs. 
		Improved speed.
		Optimized the code for mismatched channel labels (between edf file and image data).. but there are always thousands of ways of getting errors -- if there's any trouble linking the signal to subject's image just igore the image part (when choosing image folder click on cancel).
		Did some minor changes in SPM files so don't forget to replace the original functions in the SPM_toReplace folder.
		Tips: 	-- Change param in the main function to switch between GUI/no-GUI;
			-- Change notch settings in the main function (line 109) when processing data from China/US cohorts.
			-- Put bad chan index to exclude (e.g. redundant channels collected from China) in the main function.
			-- The viewer can now be used to review the results generated from origianl pipeline (SHFBXXX.mat file) by running "script_view_results.m" and select files (but still need some testing).
07/16 Update:	Fixed several bugs. 
		Improved the code to analyze unrecognized task (Thanks to Jeniffer). 
		Added significance test when running the GUI. Channels with significant activation will be marked with "*" in different colors. Still need to be tested but should become a useful tool.
		
07/21 Update:	Changed LBCN_epoch_bc function to make it more compatible with "unknown" type of task.
		Fixed a bug in LBCN_plot_HFB. Now it reads the input params correctly when using epoched signal ("Epoched_data_TASK.mat") as the input (before it was overwritting the input params using default settings).
08/01 Update:	The GUI is now compatible with new data structure. When saving figures it also saves corresponding MRI slices. 
10/08 Update:	Major update. The viewer is more compatible with different tasks/undefined task/results generated by different pipelines; To convert results generated by SPM independent pipeline, run the ConcatAll function by Pedro.
		Tips: 	-- To use the pipeline, download the entire packet (including the Preprocessing-pipeline-master folder). Before 			installing, remove any old LBCN pipeline directory in your computer. Keep SPM 12 folder in the saved directory, 			and add the new pipeline packet. 
			-- To start with the GUI, run "plot_win_App", and choose "open" (for edf) or "load" (for saved results or epoched 		 	  data) accordingly. The pipeline will try to identify the sbj name/task name, but if it failed, a window will pop 			   out to manually type in the information. You can also define new task or change baseline/epoching configurations 			    by clicking on the "Add task" button. A list of pre-defined tasks were already saved and can be chosen from this 		 	     pop-up window.  
			-- To start without the GUI, run "LBCN_preprocessing_new" to analyze new edf file, or "LBCN_plot_HFB" to open 				results or epoched files. This will also open the GUI at the end of the pipeline for better visuallization. 
			-- For the first time when opening the result of a subject, the user may need to choose the image directory on the 			   server. The pipeline will download necassary files and save them in the local directory. To open without loading 			    the image just click on cancel. 
			-- A more detailed documentation will be uploaded soon. 
10/09 Update:	Bug fix.
